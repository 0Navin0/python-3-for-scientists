Python 3 for Scientists
=======================

Welcome to the Python 3 for scientists page! The primary aim of this page is to
share information about useful new Python 3 features that may be useful to
scientists for everyday work, as well as information about things you can do
right now to prepare for the Python 3 transition, and how to try Python 3
(without necessarily switching over completely).

We also include information about Python 3 features that can be useful to
developers, but we take care to keep this separate this from the main list of
features that might be useful to typical users.
